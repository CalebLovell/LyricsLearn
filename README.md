This site was created for use by language learners and language teachers who want to use song lyrics as a fun way to improve their skills.

Users can search for and view songs created by existing users and choose any created translation to view side by side with the original lyrics. Scrolling on top of the a given line will highlight both languages, and render an explanation box with any explanations added by the user to explain a line's lyrics.

Users can also create an account and log in to create their own song lyrics, translations and explanations that will then be viewable to others.
